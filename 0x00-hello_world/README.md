## 0x00. C - Hello, World

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate various concepts in low-level programming. Below are the descriptions of each task and their respective scripts:

## [Task 0: Preprocessor](https://github.com/sulimoha/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/0-preprocessor)

### Script: `0-preprocessor`
This script takes a C file specified by the environment variable `$CFILE`, runs it through the preprocessor, and saves the result in a file named `c`. For example:
```bash
$ export CFILE=main.c
$ ./0-preprocessor
```

## [Task 1: Compiler](https://github.com/sulimoha/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/1-compiler)

### Script: `1-compiler`

This script compiles a C file specified by the environment variable `$CFILE`, but does not link it. The output file is named the same as the C file, but with the extension `.o` instead of `.c`. For example:
```bash
$ export CFILE=main.c
$ ./1-compiler
```

## [Task 2: Assembler](https://github.com/sulimoha/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/2-assembler)

### Script: `2-assembler`

This script generates the assembly code of a C file specified by the environment variable `$CFILE` and saves it in a file named `main.s`. For example:
```bash
$ export CFILE=main.c
$ ./2-assembler
```

## [Task 3: Name](https://github.com/sulimoha/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/3-name)

### Script: `3-name`

This script compiles a C file specified by the environment variable `$CFILE` and creates an executable named `cisfun`. For example:
```bash
$ export CFILE=main.c
$ ./3-name
```

## [Task 4: Hello, puts](https://github.com/sulimoha/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/4-puts.c)

### Script: `4-puts.c`

This C program prints "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle" followed by a new line using the `puts` function. The program returns 0.

## [Task 5: Hello, printf](https://github.com/sulimoha/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/5-printf.c)

### Script: `5-printf.c`

This C program prints "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art," followed by a new line using the `printf` function. The program returns 0.

## [Task 6: Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation](https://github.com/sulimoha/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/6-size.c)

### Script: `6-size.c`

This C program prints the size of various data types on the computer it is compiled and run on. It produces the same output for both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.

## [Task 7: Intel](https://github.com/sulimoha/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/100-intel)

### Script: `100-intel`

This script generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C file specified by the environment variable `$CFILE` and saves it in a file named `main.s`. For example:
```bash
$ export CFILE=main.c
$ ./100-intel
```

## [Task 8: UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity](https://github.com/sulimoha/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/101-quote.c)

### Script: `101-quote.c`

This C program prints "and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19" to the standard error (stderr). It returns 1 and does not use any functions listed in the `printf` or `puts` sections of the man pages.
